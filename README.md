## About me 
Hello there!
I am an AI ethusiast like everyone else in the world these days. My job at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/ai-engines.html) facilitates me to contribute towards making AI accessible to all. 
I was one of the intial contributors to use Deep learning techniques to solve some tough problems in computer/optical networks. I filed some patents along the way.
I contribute regularly to open source software like [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface), [SGlang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) among others.

I have put some basic info in this page, but intend to make it more elaborate :)
